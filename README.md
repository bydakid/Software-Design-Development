# University of London - Programming with Data Midterm

## Zika Virus Analysis

This project delves into the fascinating world of the Zika virus, a significant public health concern. The analysis involves examining data from reputable organizations like the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to gain a broader understanding of the virus's transmission and impact on different regions.

## Objectives

Within this project, the following objectives will be explored:

### 1. Country Transmission

- Analyze the transmission of the Zika virus in different countries.
- Investigate the categorization of countries based on transmission risk by the World Health Organization (WHO).

### 2. Brazil

- Focus on Brazil and analyze the data related to the Zika virus.
- Explore the number of Zika virus cases reported in Brazil.

## Goals for the Project Proposal

For this midterm project, the goals are as follows:

1. **Determine Data Requirements:**
   Assess the amount of data needed to effectively address the research questions and project goals. Consider factors such as data availability, time constraints, and available resources to ensure a feasible and comprehensive analysis.

2. **Data Collection:**
   Employ web scraping techniques to collect the necessary data from reputable sources like ECDC and WHO.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   Perform data cleaning and transformation procedures to prepare the collected data for analysis. This step is crucial for ensuring data accuracy and reliability.

4. **Explore Data:**
   Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights into the collected data. Visualization tools may be used to illustrate patterns and trends.

5. **Identify Key Findings:**
   Summarize and interpret the key findings derived from the analysis. Provide insights into the transmission patterns, risk categorization, and specific data related to Brazil.

## Development Details
This analyses is built entirely using Jupiter and writen in Python.
